# Wordpress OAuth2 for plugin WP-OAuth

This gem is a Work In Progress Proof Of Concept to use the Wordpress plugin [WP-OAuth](https://wp-oauth.com/).

## Usage
TBD

## TODO
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Finish Readme

## Misc
I never coded in Ruby, I'm a Python developper. I needed this for a project so here it is. It's clunky and a fork of what I actually did. This probably doesn't work as is yet.
